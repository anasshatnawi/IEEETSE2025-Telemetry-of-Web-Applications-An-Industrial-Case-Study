# Replication Package ‚Äì GWT Frontend  
This folder contains the replication artifacts for the **GWT** configuration used in our study *Telemetry of Web Applications: An Industrial Case Study*. For common instructions (global tools, telemetry backend, instrumentation agent integration, etc.), please refer to the [global README](../README.md) in the repository root.

## üîß Prerequisites  
Please ensure you have the following tools installed (see [global README](../README.md#Ô∏è-common-tools) for details):
- **Java JDK 1.8+ ‚òï**
- **Apache Maven 3.x üõ†Ô∏è**
- **GWT SDK 2.12.2**  
  *Tip: Set the `GWT_HOME` environment variable to the SDK installation directory and add it to your `PATH` for CLI access.*
- **Docker Compose üê≥** *(for launching the telemetry backend)*

---

## üöÄ Replication Steps
### 1. Launch the Telemetry Backend  
Before running the application, start the telemetry backend (refer to the [global README](../README.md#-global-replication-steps) for details):

1. Open a terminal and navigate to:
   ```sh
   cd telemetry/telemetry-backend
   ```
2. Launch the services using Docker Compose:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
3. Verify that Jaeger is accessible at [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686).

---

### 2. Instrumentation Integration  
Our prebuilt instrumentation agents are provided in the global repository. For details, see the [global README](../README.md#2-use-the-prebuilt-instrumentation-agents).
- **Frontend Agent:**  
  Located in `telemetry/instrumentation-frontend-user-experience/prebuilt`  
  *(Integrate by adding the appropriate `<script>` tag to your GWT app‚Äôs HTML file.)*  

*Note: No backend agent is needed as this replication package only includes a GWT frontend.*

---

### 3. Run the GWT Application  
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the GWT application folder:
   ```sh
   cd replication-gwt/dummy-frontend-gwt
   ```
2. Build the project using Maven:
   ```sh
   mvn clean package
   ```
3. Launch the application in development mode:
   ```sh
   mvn gwt:run
   ```
4. Once the embedded Jetty server starts, open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8888/GWTDummyApp.html
   ```
   You should see the GWT application running.

---

### 4. Interact & Verify  
- **User Interactions:** Interact with the application (e.g., fill in the text field and click the button) to generate telemetry data.
- **Trace Verification:** Open the Jaeger UI at [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686) to view and analyze the traces captured by the instrumentation agent.

*For package-specific configuration details or further instructions, please refer to the README file within the submodule.*
